<h1> My Three Hobbies </h1>
<p>My first main hobby that I love to do is practice Basketball. In my school Orthopeadic Hospital Medical Magnet High School, there is very little space for sports.
The only space we have for extracurricular activities are for volleyball and basketball. I was never really interested in basketball until I reached High School.
I began to love the sport and the way it works. I have been practicing for two years now and I love to play on my free time. It eases my mind and helps me relax.
I am currently in the school team, so I play in what I love. My best skill is shooting three pointers, many of my friends and teammates know me for that.
This hobby is something I choose to do and I really grew fond of it. <p>
<p>My second hobby I enjoy doing a lot is drawing. I am a lefty and many consider that lefties are born with creativity.
I enjoy to draw when I have free time, I feel really calm and when I'm done with my drawing, I feel accomplished. I can draw from realistic to animation, not perfectly though.
My preference to drawing is animation. I love seeing anime and I enjoy drawing the characters from scratch. It gives me a thrill when people compliment my work.
The most complex drawing I have ever done would be from a photo I took of a girl. Drawing is my second favorite hobby I love to do and love to practice.<p>
<p>My third hobby that I love to do is watching all different genres of movies. My sister owns a lot of movies and I love to binge watch all types of movies and see the different type of acting they use.
I personally like seeing horror movies because they give me a thrill watching them. Whenever I have free time at home I put on a movie and just sit back and enjoy it. I constantly do this when I have the time. Watching movies really help me relax and release stress that I have built up. I feel eased and I have no worries as I watch the movie.<p>
