<p>  I learned that leaders need to be good listeners, need to hear everyone's plans, and can handle pressure and are able
  to create solutions on their feet.  Leaders also have to analyze every little situation and plan three steps ahead
  Leaders must also focus on their teams strengths and weaknesses in order to succeed. An exapmle used was the team
  concepts of Basketball. Really good basketball teams are always talking. This means tht communication is a really important part of teamwork.
  In order to succeed, you have to feel your gut. If you feel that something is right or wrong, you have to trust your
  gut in all situations. You have to believe in what you can do and have to stay optimistic all the way.
  Doubts should never cloud your mind when you are thinking of solutions. </p>

<p> What I learned was that everything in life is relevant. A multi-millionaire came to talk to us about his experience. He explained to us that nothing is free,
  but money is not everything, you must always stay humble. Asking for help from people that know what you're trying to do is that best advice. He explained to us that people that have struggled before, know how t
  get up quick. It's all about the mental game. After people talked and shared about their special items, I learned that a lot of people have different experiences.
  The most important thing I learned was that no matter what the item is, some items have stories behind them. So if something I see as not as important,
   it may represent something precious to another. Something else I learned was the difference betweena bias question and an unbias question. A bais question is giving an assumption to an option given to influence the audiences opinion. An unbias question gives no assumptions towards the options to a question.
   An example for an unbias question would be, do you prefer a dog or a cat? A bias question would be, do you prefer a ugly dog, or a beautiful cat?
    Focus Groups, surveys, and interiews are all types of ways to collect data.

<p> What I learned was Knowlege is power. This means the person that knows more and is one sttep ahead, always succeeds in the game of life. We also learned the four types of parts in a team to create a product. They are a Project Manager, a Product Manager, a UX Designer, and a Developer. A Project Manager is the person who is on top of everyone. This person keeps track of the schedule and deadlines. This person makes sure everyone
  is on task ans that everyone is doing their job. The Product Manager is the person who collects the information and comes up with the idea for the product. This person has to create the concept and make sure that the public likes the idea.
   The UX Designer is the person who guves the product color, style, and design. This person does the creativeness of the product and what the audience finds appealing. The Developer is the person who conducts the coding. The goal for this person is to make
    the product works and functions properly. The type of thinking they do is Design Thinking. Design Thinking is an observational and human-centered approach to problem solving.
    There are five steps to this, they are Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Iterate. Empathize is learning about you audience and understanding their thought and values.
    Define is to construct a point of view and looking for patterns based on observations. Ideate is when you brainstorm to make solutions in a creative way. A Prototype is building a representation of an idea physically to test it, but making sure to fail cheap and fast.
     Iterate is returning to step one with the feedback gained in order to improve the product.

  <p> I learned that a wicked problem is a problem that is very difficult to solve. This is a human problem such as world hunger or poverty. I learned that a 10 20 30 rule is a 10 slide presentation to pitch a product that takes
     20 minutes to present with a 30 font in each slide. Guy Kawasaki explained how this is the best way to pitch a product to investers without losing intersest in the product. A problem statement is a way for everyone to focus on one problem and only one solution.
     If the problem is too vague, the problem isn't complete. If the problem is too narrow, a piece of the  community is excluded.
     Khalel Dumaz was our guest speaker that explained to us what a UX and a UI designer is and does. A UX designer is someone who makes sure the buyer or user is comfortable using the product. Their main goal is to make sure it's user friendly. UX designers go by "Look+Feel+Usability"
      The difference between a UX and a UI designer is that the UX designer focuses on the interactions, Architect, Information, and research done on the user and the product. The UI designer is the visual designer that gives it color, layouts, typography, and graphics.

  <p> Today I learned about Code Battles. Code Battles are done every Tuesday in which one representative for each team steps front to have a battle. The two types of questions are sharp shooting questions and open fire questions
  . I also learned how to discover problems. In order to come up with a problem, you have to be a expert on your topic. The Blue Ocean strategy is a small market that gets discovered newly. An example would be when plain yogurt was the trend. The Blue Ocean strategy uncovered flavored yogurt.
   I also learned about Javascript and jQuery. javascript is one of the two most common languages in the community of programming. Data Types are strings that bring variables together, there are primitive and Reference Data Types. For Loops are an executes of blocks and codes that can simplify the number of times
    you have to enter a code. Conditional Statements are Conduct different actions for different decisions made to execute a desision to be true or false.
</p>
<h1> 6-28-17 </h1>
<p>Today I learned about Python, in order to learn I have to think like a programmer. The print console is "print()" and this function shows whatever you want to print out. Printing with different data types have many different procedures. The conditional statement in Python is different than Javascript. In Python, I have to put if, then elif, and then else. For
  Python, there are many differen finctions and variables to work with. Examples are While Loops, For Loops, Lists, Functions, Classes, Random Number Generator, User Input, and Conole Input. All these preform different functions. Innovation means unique, to improve on mistakes, new answers to any problem and things that provide change.
   An API is a Application Programming Interface. This tool allows apps to be able to commmunicate and talk with eachother to transfer information. JSON is a key:value Notation to be able to define functions. A webhook is a way to provide applications with real life information. An example would be with the dominoes app, they allow you to see every minute in process of your order.
</p>
<h1> 6-29-17 </h1>
<p> Node.js is a server side for Javascript framework, it is uniformity between client and servers. Asynchronous codes let your code do several things at the the same time without pausing. JSON objects come from servers and strings. A package.json is a core to the Node.js ecosystem and the basic part of understanding. The name and version of fields and project information, liscense, data, and meta data.
   To create a package the first thing you have to do is submit to te terminal "npm init". NPM is a Node Package Manager which is a package that allows things to install. A module encapsulates related code to into a single unit of code. Angular and Typescript are another type of programming. Typescript is a language for application. Typescript adds optional types, classes, and modules to Javascript.
   Datatypes are Booleans, numbers, strings, Array, Tuple, Enum, and modules to Javascript. Angular is a modern framework built entirely in Typescript to make it easy to build applications on the web.

<p> The fourth leadership creed is "I believe in helping my brothers and my community". I believe this means that when my brother or the people I am part of need a helping hand, I must help them to bring honor to the creeds. I can apply to this my days in TXT by helping my team of my company. Not only that but I have to help my whole comany which is my Google Company. To expand on that I have to help other developers and recieve help from them as well. This is not only Google but as well as the Honda company. My community is where I live and how I relate to my community. The product that I will create this summer with my team will benefit my community and make sure that I can do anything possible to help. This is an importatn leadership creed because if I am able to help anyone in my friends and my community, I must. Some people have the opportunity to help but they don't. I will make sure I can help anyone that needs it in any siuation if possible.

    Today in class we learned about crowdsourcing and it is the practice of obtaining informationor input a task or project by enlisting the services of a larger number of people outside of you company. GoFundme is a website where you can create a place where random people can donate money into whatever your subject is. In our case it would be funding for our prooduct we will create. This is useful for work places because it makes it more organized to work. Kenzy Hinton is a Product Designer for Hulu. He gratuated from Hometown Univeristy and from Oxford Univerist for his masters. He worked for American Eagle and for google before working for Google. Color Phychology is the thought process in knowing how people react to colors in signs or in market logos. There are pros and cons to all colors in a color wheel. Blue, Red, and Yellow are the primary colors and that means that no other colors can make thse two. The secondary colors are Purple, Green, and Orange. After this it is the Tetiary colors and have a lot of different shades of colors. The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management and lean startup template for documenting old existing module businesses.

  <p> Steve Jobs speech gave a speech at the Stanford. He was the founder of Apple and Co Founder and inventor of the Macontosh. The Macontosh was the first friendly computer with beautiful Typography. Steve Jobs never graduated from college because he believed in taking classes. He believed in connecting the dots and seeing patterns and discovering what you're passionate about. He then co founded Pixar and went back to Apple to continue his life. He then was diagnosed with cancer in his pancreas and they saud he only had 3 months to live. He gave me a phrase that really stuck with me. "Life can hit you with a brick, don't lose faith" This stuck with me because I can apply this to my life by not giving up. Another thing was to stay hungry and stay hungry. I learned that life isn't easy. Steve Jobs said to always do what you want to do and never settle. This can be applied to the leadership creed number 9. I believe in doing more than asked for. I can apply this to TXT by doing the most I can.
