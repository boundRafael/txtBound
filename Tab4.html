<p>  I learned that leaders need to be good listeners, need to hear everyone's plans, and can handle pressure and are able
  to create solutions on their feet.  Leaders also have to analyze every little situation and plan three steps ahead
  Leaders must also focus on their teams strengths and weaknesses in order to succeed. An exapmle used was the team
  concepts of Basketball. Really good basketball teams are always talking. This means tht communication is a really important part of teamwork.
  In order to succeed, you have to feel your gut. If you feel that something is right or wrong, you have to trust your
  gut in all situations. You have to beleive in what you can do and have to stay optimistic all the way.
  Doubts should never cloud your mind when you are thinking of solutions. </p>

<p> What I learned was that everything in life is relevant. A multi-millionaire came to talk to us about his experience. He explained to us that nothing is free,
  but money is not everything, you must always stay humble. Asking for help from people that know what you're trying to do is that best advice. He explained to us that people that have struggled before, know how t
  get up quick. It's all about the mental game. After people talked and shared about their special items, I learned that a lot of people have different experiences.
  The most important thing I learned was that no matter what the item is, some items have stories behind them. So if something I see as not as important,
   it may represent something precious to another. Something else I learned was the difference betweena bias question and an unbias question. A bais question is giving an assumption to an option given to influence the audiences opinion. An unbias question gives no assumptions towards the options to a question.
   An example for an unbias question would be, do you prefer a dog or a cat? A bias question would be, do you prefer a ugly dog, or a beautiful cat?
    Focus Groups, surveys, and interiews are all types of ways to collect data.

<p> What I learned was Knowlege is power. This means the person that knows more and is one sttep ahead, always succeeds in the game of life. We also learned the four types of parts in a team to create a product. They are a Project Manager, a Product Manager, a UX Designer, and a Developer. A Project Manager is the person who is on top of everyone. This person keeps track of the schedule and deadlines. This person makes sure everyone
  is on task ans that everyone is doing their job. The Product Manager is the person who collects the information and comes up with the idea for the product. This person has to create the concept and make sure that the public likes the idea.
   The UX Designer is the person who guves the product color, style, and design. This person does the creativeness of the product and what the audience finds appealing. The Developer is the person who conducts the coding. The goal for this person is to make
    the product works and functions properly. The type of thinking they do is Design Thinking. Design Thinking is an observational and human-centered approach to problem solving.
    There are five steps to this, they are Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Iterate. Empathize is learning about you audience and understanding their thought and values.
    Define is to construct a point of view and looking for patterns based on observations. Ideate is when you brainstorm to make solutions in a creative way. A Prototype is building a representation of an idea physically to test it, but making sure to fail cheap and fast.
     Iterate is returning to step one with the feedback gained in order to improve the product.
