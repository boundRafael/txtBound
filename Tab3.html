 Reed Hastings is an American entrepreneur and philanthropist, which means he seeks to promote help
 to others, especially by the generous donation of money to good causes. He is the co-founder and
 CEO of Netflix, a multi million dollar program the offers world wide shows and movies. He also
 serves on the boards of Facebook and a number of non-profit organizations. He then attended the
 peace corps which offered technical support in teachings. I beleive is help from Peace Corps
 brought him to be the man he is now.
